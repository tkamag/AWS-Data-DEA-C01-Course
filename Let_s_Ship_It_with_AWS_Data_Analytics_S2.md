## Episode 3: What’s next? Let’s talk about what you can do with your data.
The cloud empowers organizations to consolidate diverse data into a scalable data lake, enabling analysts to uncover impactful insights. Massive compute capacity drives real-time analytics and predictive modeling with machine learning. Data visualization and BI tools share insights across the organization to inform better decision making. Cloud data services break down silos, enhance customer understanding, optimize operations, reduce costs, identify new revenue opportunities, and strategically improve competitive advantage.
